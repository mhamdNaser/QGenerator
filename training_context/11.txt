Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was born in Mecca in the year 570 CE, into the Quraysh tribe, from the Banu Hashim clan. His father, Abdullah, passed away before his birth, and his mother, Amina bint Wahb, died when he was six years old. He grew up as an orphan, and his grandfather, Abdul Muttalib, took care of him, followed by his uncle, Abu Talib.

He was known among his people before prophethood by the title "The Truthful and Trustworthy" due to his honesty and integrity. He worked as a shepherd and later in trade, and married Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, who was the first to believe in him.

At the age of 40, he was chosen by Allah as a Prophet, receiving revelation through the Angel Jibreel (Gabriel) in the Cave of Hira. He called people to worship Allah alone and abandon idol worship. In the early years, he faced harsh persecution from the Quraysh, but he remained patient and steadfast.

The Prophet (PBUH) migrated to Medina after the persecution became unbearable. There, he established the first Islamic state and drafted the Constitution of Medina, which regulated relations between Muslims and Jews. He also established brotherhood between the emigrants (Muhajirun) and the helpers (Ansar). He participated in numerous battles, including Badr, Uhud, and the Battle of the Trench.

He entered Mecca as a conqueror in the eighth year of Hijra, declaring amnesty for its inhabitants. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) passed away in Medina in the 11th year of Hijra after completing his mission of delivering the message.
