A volcano is an opening in a planet's crust through which molten rock, ash, and gases escape from beneath the surface. These eruptions can form mountains or hills and are caused by the movement of tectonic plates and the accumulation of pressure from magma chambers.

Volcanoes are classified into three main types based on their activity: active (currently erupting or showing signs of erupting soon), dormant (not currently active but may erupt again), and extinct (no longer expected to erupt).

The structure of a volcano typically includes a magma chamber, main vent, crater, and sometimes secondary vents. The shape and eruption style of a volcano can vary, leading to different types such as shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes, and cinder cone volcanoes.

Volcanic eruptions can have both constructive and destructive effects. While they can cause loss of life and property damage, they also create fertile soils, form new land, and release gases that can influence the climate.

Monitoring volcanoes involves using seismographs, gas sensors, and satellite imagery to predict eruptions and mitigate risks to nearby populations.
