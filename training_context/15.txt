The Solar System consists of the Sun and eight planets that orbit around it, along with moons, comets, asteroids, and meteoroids. The Sun is the central star of the system and provides the light and heat essential for life on Earth.

The eight planets are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These planets are divided into two groups: rocky inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) and gaseous outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune).

Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and is small and heavily cratered. Venus is known for its thick atmosphere and extreme heat. Earth is the only known planet to support life. Mars is often called the Red Planet due to its iron-rich soil.

Jupiter is the largest planet and has a famous Great Red Spot, which is a massive storm. Saturn is well known for its spectacular rings made of ice and rock. Uranus is unique because it rotates on its side and appears blue due to methane gas. Neptune is the farthest planet and is known for its strong winds.

The planets revolve around the Sun in elliptical orbits due to gravity. They also rotate on their own axes, causing the cycle of day and night. Most planets have moons, with Earthâ€™s moon being the most well-known.
