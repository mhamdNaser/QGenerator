"The Merchant of Venice" is one of William Shakespeare's most famous plays. It is set in the city of Venice, Italy, and follows the story of the merchant Antonio, who faces a major financial crisis and borrows money from Shylock, a Jewish moneylender. The two make a strange agreement: if Antonio fails to repay the loan on time, he will give Shylock a pound of his flesh. The plot becomes complicated when Antonio's friend Bassanio is involved and falls in love with Portia, who plays a crucial role in saving the situation with a clever legal trick.
