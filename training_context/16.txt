The Umayyad Caliphate was the first hereditary Islamic state, established by Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan in 661 CE after the abdication of Hasan ibn Ali. The Umayyads made Damascus their capital and reached their greatest territorial extent during the reign of Caliph Al-Walid ibn Abd al-Malik, stretching from China in the east to southern France in the west.

The Umayyads were known for their significant military expansions, notably the conquest of Andalusia by Tariq ibn Ziyad, and the spread of Islamic rule into the eastern regions up to the borders of India. Notable Umayyad caliphs include Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, who unified the state and introduced Islamic coinage, and Al-Walid ibn Abd al-Malik, who oversaw major architectural projects like the Umayyad Mosque. Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz was known for his justice, piety, and his efforts to return to the practices of the Rashidun caliphs.

Despite their successes, the Umayyad Caliphate faced numerous revolts, especially from the Shi’a, Khawarij, and non-Arabs (mawali). These internal struggles and the growing social inequalities contributed to the eventual downfall of the Umayyad dynasty in 750 CE after the Battle of the Zab, when the Abbasids took control. However, the Umayyad legacy continued in Spain, where Abd al-Rahman I established the Umayyad Emirate in Córdoba in 756 CE.
