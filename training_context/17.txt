The Rashidun Caliphate refers to the period following the death of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in 11 AH, continuing until 40 AH. During this period, four of the Prophet's companions, known as the Rashidun (Rightly Guided Caliphs), ruled: Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, Umar ibn al-Khattab, Uthman ibn Affan, and Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with them all). This era was characterized by justice, consultation, and adherence to the principles of Islam, setting an example of righteous governance.

Abu Bakr al-Siddiq was the first caliph and faced the Ridda Wars (Wars of Apostasy) to stabilize the Islamic state. He was succeeded by Umar ibn al-Khattab, under whose leadership the Islamic empire expanded greatly, including the conquest of the Levant, Iraq, and Egypt. He also established key administrative systems such as the establishment of the Diwan (government registers). Uthman ibn Affan succeeded Umar and is known for standardizing the Quran into a single text, but his caliphate was marked by internal dissent and ended with his assassination. The final Rashidun caliph, Ali ibn Abi Talib, faced significant challenges, including the Battles of the Camel and Siffin, and his rule ended with his martyrdom.

Despite the political challenges and internal conflicts, the Rashidun Caliphate remains a model of leadership that adhered closely to Islamic principles, especially the practice of Shura (consultation).
